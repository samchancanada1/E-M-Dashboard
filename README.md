# E-M-Dashboard

An Expense Management Dashboard with both Flutter and React frontend options, powered by a backend server and PostgreSQL database.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Frontend (Flutter Web)**: Dart, Flutter
- **Frontend (React)**: React (structure referenced)
- **Backend**: Go (Golang)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose

## ðŸš€ Getting Started with Docker

To run the application with Docker:

```bash
# Navigate into the project root directory
cd E-M-Dashboard

# Build and start all services
# Use the appropriate command based on your Docker version:
docker-compose up --build
# or
docker compose up --build
```

This will start:
- `backend` on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- `frontend_react` on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `frontend_flutter` on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
- `PostgreSQL` on port `5432`

## ðŸ“¡ API Endpoints

The backend folder is missing, so the list of API endpoints is not available. Once included, common endpoints may look like:

```
POST   /signup
POST   /verify-otp
GET    /onboarding/services
POST   /onboarding/user
GET    /users
GET    /transactions
```

## ðŸ“˜ Swagger Documentation

Once the backend is available, you can access the interactive API documentation (if Swagger is set up) at:

```
http://localhost:8080/api-docs
```

This provides a web UI to explore and test the API endpoints.
